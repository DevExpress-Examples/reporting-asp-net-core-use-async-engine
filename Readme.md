# Reporting for ASP.NET Core - How to Use the Asynchronous Engine
 
## Overview 

This example demonstrates how to implement and use custom services, which allow you to save, load, and export reports asynchronously.
  
This application registers a service with the [IReportProviderAsync](https://docs.devexpress.com/XtraReports/DevExpress.XtraReports.Services.IReportProviderAsync) interface. The latter allows you to perform the following tasks asynchronously: 
- open subreports from the master report; 
- resolve a unique identifier to a report (an operation that affects the Designer Preview and Document Viewer performance). 

In general, asynchronous operation mode gives you the following advantages: 
- It handles threads in web applications more cautiously and returns threads to the thread pool while the operation is in progress.  
- You can write safe asynchronous code in a project with a third-party library that uses only asynchronous API. 
 
 You can use an asynchronous engine in the following scenarios: 
- Handle the End User Report Designer and Web Document Viewer events to load data or create a document asynchronously. The key point is that these actions can be performed in the context of the current HTTP request in the [WebDocumentViewerOperationLogger](https://docs.devexpress.com/XtraReports/DevExpress.XtraReports.Web.WebDocumentViewer.WebDocumentViewerOperationLogger) and  [PreviewReportCustomizationService](https://docs.devexpress.com/XtraReports/DevExpress.XtraReports.Web.ReportDesigner.Services.PreviewReportCustomizationService) class methods. 
- Drill Through navigation in the Web Document Viewer. Use the  **IDrillThroughProcessorAsync** interface. 
- If an application uses JWT-based Authentication, use the **IWebDocumentViewerExportResultUriGeneratorAsync** interface to load exported documents to the storage asynchronously. 

## Implementation Details 

### Perequisites 

To get started, create a sample project with our ASP.NET Core Reporting Project Template. 

### Report Provider 

The `CustomReportProviderAsync.cs` file contains a class that implements the [DevExpress.XtraReports.Services.IReportProviderAsync](https://docs.devexpress.com/XtraReports/DevExpress.XtraReports.Services.IReportProviderAsync) interface and calls the report storage's [ReportStorageWebExtension.GetDataAsync](https://docs.devexpress.com/XtraReports/DevExpress.XtraReports.Web.Extensions.ReportStorageWebExtension.GetDataAsync(System.String)) method. 

### Report Storage 

The `CustomReportStorageWebExtension.cs` file contains a class that implements a custom report storage with asynchronous methods. The **CustomReportStorageWebExtension** class inherits from the [ReportStorageWebExtension](https://docs.devexpress.com/XtraReports/DevExpress.XtraReports.Web.Extensions.ReportStorageWebExtension) and overrides all its public methods. Note that methods, which cannot be used in asynchronous mode, throw exceptions.

### Report Model and Controllers

The Home controller uses the **GetModelAsync** methods to generate report models and send them to the End User Report Designer and Document Viewer.  
You cannot use asynchronous API if the Bind method receives a report instance or a string (ReportUrl) as a parameter. Bind report controls to the [ReportDesignerModel](https://docs.devexpress.com/XtraReports/DevExpress.XtraReports.Web.ReportDesigner.ReportDesignerModel) or [WebDocumentViewerModel](https://docs.devexpress.com/XtraReports/DevExpress.XtraReports.Web.WebDocumentViewer.WebDocumentViewerModel) objects originated from controllers. The controller-based model allows you to use asynchronous API and avoid obscure problems. Such problems may occur when a subreport fails to load and throws an exception, or when a dynamic list of parameter values fails to retrieve its data.

### ExportToPdf Action 

The export action takes advantage of the **IReportProviderAsync** service that resolves report ID to a report and expedites the load of subreports without the need for the web report controls. The DI container injects the **IReportProviderAsync** service into the XtraReport instance. Then, the asynchronous **CreateDocumentAsync** method creates a document and the asynchronous **ExportToPdfAsync** method exports the document to PDF.

### Enable Asynchronous Services

Request handlers in ASP.NET Core applications are asynchronous. To enable asynchronous services, call the **UseAsyncEngine** method at application startup:

```csharp
services.ConfigureReportingServices(configurator => { 
    configurator.ConfigureReportDesigner(designerConfigurator => { 
        //.. 
    }); 
    configurator.ConfigureWebDocumentViewer(viewerConfigurator => { 
        //.. 
    }); 
    configurator.UseAsyncEngine(); 
});
```
